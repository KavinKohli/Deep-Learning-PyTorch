#  Deep-Learning-PyTorch

A complete learning repository for **Deep Learning using PyTorch**, covering everything from tensors and neural networks to training pipelines and real-world projects.

This repository is built as a **learning + portfolio** project — every notebook here represents a concept I have learned and implemented from scratch.

---

##  Why this repository exists

Deep Learning is not about just using libraries — it is about understanding:
- How neural networks work  
- How gradients flow  
- How loss functions & optimizers train models  
- How real training pipelines are built  

This repository documents that journey in a **structured, practical way**.

---

##  Tech Stack

- Python  
- PyTorch  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

---

##  Topics Covered

(Updated as I learn more)

- PyTorch Tensors & Operations  
- Automatic Differentiation (Autograd)

---

*(This structure grows as new topics and projects are added.)*
