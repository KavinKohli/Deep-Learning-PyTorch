#  Deep-Learning-PyTorch

A complete learning repository for **Deep Learning using PyTorch**, covering everything from tensors and neural networks to training pipelines and real-world projects.

This repository is built as a **learning + portfolio** project — every notebook here represents a concept I have learned and implemented from scratch.

---

##  Why this repository exists

Deep Learning is not about just using libraries — it is about understanding:
- How neural networks work  
- How gradients flow  
- How loss functions & optimizers train models  
- How real training pipelines are built  

This repository documents that journey in a **structured, practical way**.

##  Tech Stack

- Python  
- PyTorch  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib

(Updated as I learn more)

# 📅 Deep Learning with PyTorch — Daily Progress

## Day 1 — PyTorch Basics
Learned what PyTorch is, why it’s used, how to import it, and the core idea of tensors.

## Day 2 — Tensor Creation
Created tensors (scalars, vectors, matrices), used zeros, ones, random tensors, and explored shapes.

## Day 3 — Tensor Operations
Performed tensor arithmetic, matrix multiplication, aggregations, and inspected tensor properties.

## Day 4 — Tensor Manipulation + NumPy
Learned reshaping, stacking, indexing, and converting between NumPy arrays and PyTorch tensors.

## Day 5 — Device & Reproducibility
Set random seeds, ensured reproducibility, and moved tensors between CPU and GPU.

## Day 6 — Binary Classification
Built a binary classification model, prepared data, and defined loss functions and optimizers.

## Day 7 — Training Loop & Evaluation
Implemented training loops, backpropagation, evaluation metrics, and visualized predictions.

## Day 8 — Multiclass Classification
Trained a multiclass classifier using Softmax and CrossEntropyLoss and evaluated performance.

## Day 9 — Putting It All Together
Improved models using non-linearities and summarized the full classification pipeline.

## ✅ Status
Fundamentals and Classification (Chapter 02) completed. Next: Computer Vision (CNNs).
